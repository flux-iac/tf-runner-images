# tf-runner images

This community repository offers Dockerfiles prepared to build `tf-runner` container images for [TF-Controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller).
These images incorporate MPL `terraform` binaries (up to v1.5.x) and BSL `terraform` binaries (from v1.6.0 going forward) from HashiCorp's [Terraform Community Edition](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform).

If you decide to leverage the BSL tf-runner container images offered in this repository, it's imperative that you adhere to [HashiCorp's BSL/BUSL 1.1](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/main/LICENSE).
